# Contribution Guidelines

To ensure project consistency and prevent data loss, please adhere to the following rules:

1.  **Do Not Overwrite `journey.md`**: The `journey.md` file is a historical log of the project's development. New entries should always be **appended** to the end of the file. Do not delete or overwrite existing content.

2.  **Preserve `README.md` Commands**: The `README.md` file contains important commands and shortcuts for project development. Do not remove or alter these commands without explicit confirmation.
