# Terms of Service

**Last updated: January 29, 2026**

This is a placeholder for your app's Terms of Service. You must replace this with your own terms before publishing your app.

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By using our mobile application (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.

## 2. Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or the app owner cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or through the Apple App Store.

## 3. Content

Our Service allows you to create, store, and manage your personal challenge data. This data is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for the content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

## 4. Limitation Of Liability

In no event shall the app owner, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.

## 5. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of your country of residence, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
