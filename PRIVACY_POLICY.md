# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 29, 2026**

This is a placeholder for your app's Privacy Policy. You must replace this with a real privacy policy before publishing your app.

## Information Collection and Use

A real privacy policy should detail the types of information your app collects and how it is used. For this app:
- **Local Data:** All challenge data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any server.
- **Anonymous Analytics (if any):** If you use analytics services like Google Analytics for Firebase, you must disclose what data is collected (e.g., device type, OS version, usage patterns).
- **In-App Purchases:** If you use RevenueCat or another service, mention that purchase-related data (like anonymous user IDs and entitlement status) is managed by them.

## Third-Party Services

Disclose any third-party services you use, such as:
- RevenueCat
- Google Analytics
- AdMob

## Your Consent

By using our app, you consent to our Privacy Policy.
