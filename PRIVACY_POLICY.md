# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 29, 2026**

This is a placeholder for your app's Privacy Policy. You must replace this with a real privacy policy before publishing your app.

## Data Privacy: Your Data is Your Own

We believe your personal data should be private. Our philosophy is simple: you own your data, and it should stay with you.

### Local-First Data Storage
All data you create in this app, including your challenges, progress, and streaks, is stored **exclusively on your device**. 
- The data **never** leaves your device.
- We **do not** have access to it.
- We **do not** transmit it to our servers or any third-party servers.
- If you delete the app, all your data is permanently deleted along with it.

This means your challenge data is completely private and under your control.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect any personal information, such as your name, email address, or location. We do not use any analytics services to track your usage patterns.

## Third-Party Services & In-App Purchases

The only third-party service we use is **RevenueCat** to manage optional Pro subscriptions. When you consider a purchase, RevenueCat may collect an anonymous user ID to manage your subscription status. We do not receive any personally identifiable information from this process. For more details, please see the RevenueCat privacy policy.
