### Day 6 — 2026-02-01

**What we shipped today**
- **Web-Hosted Documentation Live**: The application's legal and informational documents (About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Support) are now live and accessible at `https://nodelabstudio.github.io/ht_appstore/`. This ensures easy access for users and compliance with App Store requirements.

**What we decided**
- To host the application's legal and informational documents publicly for accessibility and App Store compliance.

**What broke / what we learned**
- Setting up GitHub Pages for simple web hosting is an efficient way to make documentation publicly available.

**Tomorrow's target**
- Prepare for next development cycle (V2) or continued app testing and App Store submission.

**X post draft (short)**
Day 6: Docs are live! 📄 Our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and About pages are now hosted and publicly accessible for Quest 30. Ready for App Store review.
Biggest lesson: Public documentation is key for trust & compliance.
Tomorrow: Next steps for Quest 30!
