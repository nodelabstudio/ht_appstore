# journey.md — Build Log for X (Daily Posts)

## Why this file exists
This is the running log of how the app idea evolved and what we built each day, written in a way that can be adapted into daily X posts.

## Origin story (short)
We started with a “Bible Sleep / lullaby verses” idea, discovered via Astro that search demand was low for those terms, then pivoted to ASO-driven idea selection. We tested “tap counter” and found high downloads but low revenue, indicating a mostly free/ad market. We then validated higher-revenue categories and chose a subscription-friendly direction: a **Quest 30**, using the **Streaks-style UI** as inspiration.

## Research timeline (what happened)
### 1) Initial idea + constraint setting
- Goal: ship one app in 2 weeks, ASO-first, no heavy APIs/backends, subscription-only.

### 2) Astro exploration
- “Bible sleep” keywords showed low popularity → pivoted to broader utility seeds.
- Explored seed keywords: counter, timer, fasting, habit, tracker, streak.

### 3) Validation loop
- Found “tap counter” opportunity (winnable difficulty) but Sensor Tower showed low revenue vs downloads.
- Interpreted as a “free market” keyword cluster (hard to justify subscription).

### 4) Pivot to subscription-friendly markets
- Validated “fasting” and “habit/streak” as higher revenue clusters.
- Chose a direction that supports subscription **without requiring a backend**:
  **Quest 30** (program packs + widgets + stats).

### 5) Locked V1
Challenge packs:
- No Sugar 30
- Daily Walk 30
- Read 10 Pages 30

Core loop:
Open → tap Done → day completes → streak continues

Screens (V1):
Home, Challenge Detail, Stats, Add Challenge, Paywall, Settings

## Daily Build Log

### Day 1 — 2026-01-26

**What we shipped today**
- Set up GSD workflow with PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md
- Defined 4 phases with clear success criteria
- Created 34 requirements mapped to phases
- Researched Flutter stack: Riverpod, Hive, timezone handling

**What we decided**
- iOS-only for V1 (faster ship, simpler widget implementation)
- RevenueCat for IAP (faster paywall wiring)
- Riverpod for state management (compile-safe, modern)
- Hive for storage (simple, widget-compatible via App Groups)
- Preset packs only, no custom challenges (reduces scope)

**What broke / what we learned**
- ASO research showed "tap counter" has high downloads but low revenue — free market
- Pivoted to subscription-friendly "habit/streak" cluster instead

**Tomorrow's target**
- Execute Phase 1: Foundation & Core Flow

**X post draft (short)**
Day 1: Planned the entire Quest 30 app.
34 requirements across 4 phases. Local-first, no backend.
Biggest lesson: ASO research before coding saves you from building the wrong thing.
Tomorrow: Building the core flow.

### Day 2 — 2026-01-27

**What we shipped today**
- Phase 1 complete: 5 plans, 1,786 lines of Dart code, 17 files
- Flutter project with Hive persistence and timezone-safe streak calculator
- Challenge and ChallengePack domain models
- ChallengeRepository with full CRUD operations
- Riverpod AsyncNotifier for reactive state management
- Home screen with GridView and progress rings
- Pack selection and challenge creation screens
- Challenge detail screen with Done/Undo buttons
- Light/dark theme support with Material 3

**What we decided**
- Used List<int> instead of Set<int> for completions (Hive limitation)
- Standard Riverpod providers instead of @riverpod codegen (analyzer conflict)
- Full list reload after mutations (simplicity over optimistic updates for V1)
- Large 200px progress ring on detail screen for visual prominence

**What broke / what we learned**
- riverpod_generator conflicted with hive_generator's analyzer version
- Flutter's DateUtils class conflicts with custom DateUtils — renamed to AppDateUtils
- Wave-based parallel execution worked well: 3 plans in parallel for Wave 3

**Tomorrow's target**
- Phase 2: iOS Integration (widgets and notifications)

**X post draft (short)**
Day 2: Phase 1 done. The app works.
Create a challenge, tap Done, streak grows, data persists.
1,786 lines of Dart, 17 files, timezone-safe streak logic.
Tomorrow: Widgets and notifications.

### Day 3 — 2026-01-29

**What we shipped today**
- Phase 2 & 3 features verified and polished.
- **Stats Screen**: Implemented a new screen showing "Total Completions" and "Best Overall Streak".
- **Settings Screen Polish**: Wired up all placeholder buttons (Restore, Support, Legal) to be functional.
- **Build Readiness**: Successfully built a deployable iOS `.ipa` file after resolving signing issues.
- **Testing**: Added the first widget test for the `StatsScreen`.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed a critical regression that blocked adding new challenges by adding a debug-mode bypass for the paywall.
    - Made the legal links in the Settings screen functional by creating placeholder documents and using a live placeholder URL.

**What we decided**
- To use a simple `_inDebugMode` flag to bypass the paywall during development, which is crucial for testing without a valid App Store subscription.
- To use a direct path for Hive initialization (`Hive.init()`) in the widget test environment to resolve persistent issues with mocking platform-specific packages (`path_provider`).
- To create placeholder markdown files for legal documents and link to them with a generic placeholder URL for immediate testability.

**What broke / what we learned**
- File synchronization is key. It can seem like changes are "lost" if the app isn't re-run after the agent modifies files. The fix is to always ensure a fresh build is running.
- Flutter's test setup can be tricky. Mocking platform-specific dependencies like `path_provider` can be complex; sometimes a direct, test-specific implementation is a more pragmatic solution.
- Xcode code signing for a real device or TestFlight requires user interaction. We had to register a physical device to allow Xcode to create the necessary development provisioning profiles.

**Tomorrow's target**
- V1 is functionally complete. The next step is user testing on a physical device and preparing for App Store submission.

**X post draft (short)**
Day 3: V1 complete.
Shipped a stats screen, polished the UI, and successfully built the deployable `.ipa` for TestFlight.
Biggest lesson: Test environment setup can be as complex as the feature itself.
Tomorrow: User testing.

### Day 4 — 2026-01-30

**What we shipped today**
- Expanded the range of available habit packs to make the app feel more premium and offer more choices. Added:
    - Digital Detox 30
    - Morning Meditation 30
    - Sketch a Day 30
    - No Alcohol 30
    - Journaling 30
    - Jogging 30
    - Praying 30
    - Abstinence 30

**What we decided**
- To prioritize user choice and app premium feel by offering a broader selection of challenge packs.

**What broke / what we learned**
- The app's modular design made it easy to extend existing data models without affecting core logic.

**Tomorrow's target**
- Consider implementing a custom challenge creation feature or enhancing existing pack management.

**X post draft (short)**
Day 4: Added 8 new habit packs! From Digital Detox to Jogging, more choices for a premium experience.
Biggest lesson: A flexible data model makes expansion easy.
Tomorrow: Exploring custom challenges.

### Day 5 — 2026-01-31

**What we shipped today**
- **V1 Feature Completion & Polish**:
    - **Stats Screen**: Implemented a new `StatsScreen` to display aggregated statistics ("Total Completions", "Best Overall Streak").
    - **Settings UI Polish**: Wired up all UI elements in the `SettingsScreen`, including dynamic app version display and functional links for "Restore Purchases", "Contact Support", "Privacy Policy", and "Terms of Service".
    - **Build Readiness**: Successfully generated a deployable iOS `.ipa` file, confirming the application's readiness for TestFlight distribution.
- **Bug Fixes & User Feedback**:
    - **"Add Challenge" Regression Fix**: Resolved the critical bug that prevented users from adding new challenges by implementing a debug-mode paywall bypass for easier development.
    - **Data Privacy Enhancement**: Based on user questions, updated `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` to be crystal clear about the local-first data storage model, ensuring users know their data is private and never transmitted.
- **Content Expansion**:
    - Added nine new diverse habit packs (including Digital Detox, Morning Meditation, and Read Bible 30) to enrich user choices and enhance the app's premium feel.
- **V2 Planning**:
    - Formally documented the "Custom Challenge Creation" feature in `.planning/PROJECT.md` as a planned V2 enhancement.
- **Documentation**: Maintained and updated the `journey.md` build log to reflect daily progress, key decisions, and lessons learned throughout the development process.

**What we decided**
- To always re-verify file state and re-run the app to ensure both the agent and user are synchronized, preventing "lost changes" confusion.
- To formally document user feature requests into the project planning documents for future development cycles.
- To make the privacy policy as explicit and transparent as possible regarding the local-first, no-tracking nature of the app.

**What broke / what we learned**
- A flawed `replace` operation can introduce syntax errors that break the build; overwriting the entire file with a corrected version is a robust fix.
- Continuous user verification and clear communication are essential to ensure the development process stays on track and meets expectations.

**Tomorrow's target**
- Final verification and prepare for next development cycle.

**X post draft (short)**
Day 5: Productive end to the week! Polished the UI, fixed a key bug, added 9 new challenge packs, and enhanced the privacy policy to be crystal clear: your data is yours, period. V1 is solid.
Biggest lesson: User feedback is the fastest way to a better product.
Tomorrow: Docs & launch prep.

### Day 6 — 2026-02-01

**What we shipped today**
- **Web-Hosted Documentation Live**: The application's legal and informational documents (About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Support) are now live and accessible at `https://nodelabstudio.github.io/ht_appstore/`. This ensures easy access for users and compliance with App Store requirements.

**What we decided**
- To host the application's legal and informational documents publicly for accessibility and App Store compliance.

**What broke / what we learned**
- Setting up GitHub Pages for simple web hosting is an efficient way to make documentation publicly available.

**Tomorrow's target**
- Prepare for next development cycle (V2) or continued app testing and App Store submission.

**X post draft (short)**
Day 6: Docs are live! 📄 Our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and About pages are now hosted and publicly accessible for Quest 30. Ready for App Store review.
Biggest lesson: Public documentation is key for trust & compliance.

### Day 7 — 2026-01-30

**What we shipped today**
- **Monetization: Paywall Gate Implemented**: We successfully implemented the paywall gate. Free users with an active challenge now encounter the RevenueCat native paywall when attempting to create a new challenge, while Pro users bypass this gate. This is a core monetization mechanic.
- **Settings Screen Expanded**: The settings screen was significantly expanded to meet App Store compliance and enhance user support. This includes:
    - Restore Purchases functionality.
    - Direct Contact Support email link.
    - Links to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (now hosted on the new documentation site).
    - Dynamic display of the app version.

**What we decided**
- To leverage RevenueCat's native paywall for monetization, focusing on a frictionless upgrade path for users.
- To ensure App Store compliance by providing clear restore purchase options and links to legal documents directly within the app settings.

**What broke / what we learned**
- Confirmed that RevenueCat's native paywall UI does not display in the simulator, which is expected behavior for in-app purchase testing. Testing on a physical device with a TestFlight build is essential for full verification.
- Validated the efficiency of using for external links and for dynamic versioning, streamlining compliance requirements.

**Tomorrow's target**
- Finalize Phase 3 with end-to-end verification of monetization and settings.

**X post draft (short)**
Day 7: Monetization & Settings done! 💰 Paywall gate active & Settings screen upgraded with restore purchases, support, and legal links. Ready for final Phase 3 verification. #FlutterDev #RevenueCat #AppStore
