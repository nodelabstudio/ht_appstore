    <h1>Privacy Policy for Quest 30</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 31, 2026</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to Quest 30. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our philosophy is simple: you own your data, and it should stay with you.</p>

    <h2>Data Privacy: Your Data is Your Own</h2>
    <h3>Local-First Data Storage</h3>
    <p>All data you create in <strong>Quest 30</strong>, including your challenges, progress, and streaks, is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> in a private, sandboxed location.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The data <strong>never</strong> leaves your device.</li>
        <li>We, the developers of <strong>Quest 30</strong>, <strong>do not</strong> have access to it.</li>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> transmit it to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
        <li>If you delete the app from your device, all your data is permanently deleted along with it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This means your challenge data is completely private and under your control.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Quest 30</strong> does not collect any personal information, such as your name, email address, or location. We do not use any analytics services to track your usage patterns.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services & In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The only third-party service we use is <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage the optional "Pro" subscription. When you consider a purchase, RevenueCat may collect an anonymous user ID to manage your subscription status and validate purchases with the App Store. We do not receive any personally identifiable information from this process. For more details, please see the RevenueCat privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
